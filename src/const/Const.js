export const contentText = "What is news, it is not what is true. It is what people want to believe. And it is the people who decide what’s true and what they want. And, of course, that’s why we have all of those “experts” on TV. They’re the ones who know what’s best. And they’re not experts. They are in fact, part of the problem. They aren’t looking at the facts. They don’t even know what the facts are. All they know is what they think the public wants to hear. That’s what makes them experts. To a lot of people in the world, what they are interested in is what’s going on in the news. The news is the most important source of information they have for their lives. They believe it to be the only way to know what is true and what is not. They don’t trust anything else. They rely on the information that the news gives them for life."
